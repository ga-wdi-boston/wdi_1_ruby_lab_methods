## Lab 2: That's All Folks

Write a method called `toonify` that takes two parameters, `accent` and `sentence`. If `accent` is the symbol `:daffy`, return a modified version of `sentence` with all "s" replaced with "th". If the accent is `:elmer`, replace all "r" with "w". Feel free to add your own accents as well! If the accent is not recognized, just return the sentence as-is.
