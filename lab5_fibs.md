## Lab 5: Fibonacci's Revenge

Consider the [Fibonacci sequence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number): 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, etc. Each term is obtained by adding the two terms before it, except for the first two terms, which are always 1.

### Step 1

Write a *non-recursive* method called `iterative_fibs` that takes a single parameter called `length` and returns an array of all the Fibonacci numbers up to that length.

### Step 2

Write a *recursive* method called `recursive_fibs` that behaves identically to the method you wrote in Step 1.
